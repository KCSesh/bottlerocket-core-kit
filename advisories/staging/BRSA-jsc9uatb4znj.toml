severity = "moderate"
description = "A flaw was found in amazon-ssm-agent that could cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This could cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected."
